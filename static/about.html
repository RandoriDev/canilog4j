<h1>About This Page</h1>

<p>This site, canilog4j.com, is sponsored and maintained by <a href="https://randori.com">Randori</a>. The objective of this site is to consolidate and normalize the public data sources of log4j affected software. The community-driven sources indicate software may be impacted by the log4j vulnerabilities and, in cases where the community has provided the information, link back to the source of the data. The underlying data is parsed from public respositories, including:
<ul><li>CISAGov <a href="https://github.com/cisagov/log4j-affected-db">https://github.com/cisagov/log4j-affected-db</a></li>
    <li>NCSC-NL <a href="https://github.com/NCSC-NL/log4shell">https://github.com/NCSC-NL/log4shell</a></li>
</ul>
For certian software titles Randori has contributed additional information directly to this database. Because this site consolidates data, we have not reviewed each claim and you may find some claims are incorrect. The data sources are also updated regularly and information changes as additional contributors interpret vendor statements and provide or learn new information.
