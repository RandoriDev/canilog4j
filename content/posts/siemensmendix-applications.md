| [CISAGov](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cisagov/log4j-affected-db/develop/README.md) | Although the Mendix runtime itself is not vulnerable to this exploit, we nevertheless recommend to upgrade log4j-core to the latest available version if log4j-core is part of your project. This advice is regardless of the JRE/JDK version the app runs on. See [Mendix Statement](https://status.mendix.com/incidents/8j5043my610c) for more details. See further recommendations from [Siemens Advisory SSA-661257](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-661247.pdf) |
