| [CISAGov](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cisagov/log4j-affected-db/develop/README.md) | Although the Cloud Foundry environment itself is not vulnerable to this exploit, we nevertheless recommend to upgrade log4j-core to the latest available version if log4j-core is part of your project. See more update information [here](https://support.sw.siemens.com/en-US/product/268530510/knowledge-base/PL8600797).
