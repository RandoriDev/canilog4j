| [NCSC-NL](https://github.com/NCSC-NL/log4shell/blob/main/software/README.md) | CVE-2021-4104: Not vuln ; CVE-2021-44228: Fix </ul> |
| [CISAGov](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cisagov/log4j-affected-db/develop/README.md) | To clarify and avoid confusion: The 1.14.1 / 1.13.4 / 1.12.6 / 1.11.5 releases, which were supposed to only contain a Log4j upgrade to 2.15.0, were skipped because CVE-2021-45046 was discovered during the release publication. The new 1.14.2 / 1.13.5 / 1.12.7 / 1.11.6 releases include a version upgrade for Log4j to version 2.16.0 to address CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. |
