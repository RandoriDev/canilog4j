| [CISAGov](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cisagov/log4j-affected-db/develop/README.md) | While the Hologic software itself does not utilize Java/Log4J, there is a utility program installed that may utilize Java and Log4J. This utility program does not run on startup and is not required for system operation. Please contact Hologic Service for assistance in removing this program. |
