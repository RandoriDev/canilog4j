| [CISAGov](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cisagov/log4j-affected-db/develop/README.md) | Google Kubernetes Engine does not use Log4j 2 and is not impacted by the issues identified in CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046.  Customers may have introduced a separate logging solution that uses Log4j 2. We strongly encourage customers who manage Google Kubernetes Engine environments to identify components dependent on Log4j 2 and update them to the latest version. |
