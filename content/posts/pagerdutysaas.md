| [CISAGov](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cisagov/log4j-affected-db/develop/README.md) | We currently see no evidence of compromises on our platform. Our teams continue to monitor for new developments and for impacts on sub-processors and dependent systems. PagerDuty SaaS customers do not need to take any additional action for their PagerDuty SaaS environment |
