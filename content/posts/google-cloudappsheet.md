| [CISAGov](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cisagov/log4j-affected-db/develop/README.md) | The AppSheet core platform runs on non-JVM (non-Java) based runtimes. At this time, we have identified no impact to core AppSheet functionality. Additionally, we have patched one Java-based auxiliary service in our platform. We will continue to monitor for affected services and patch or remediate as required. If you have any questions or require assistance, contact AppSheet Support. |
