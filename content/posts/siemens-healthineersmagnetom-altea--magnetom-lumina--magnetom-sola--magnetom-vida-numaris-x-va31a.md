| [CISAGov](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cisagov/log4j-affected-db/develop/README.md) | LOG4J is used in the context of the help system. Workaround: close port 8090 for standalone systems. Setup IP whitelisting for "need to access" systems to network port 8090 in case a second console is connected. |
