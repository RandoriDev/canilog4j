| [NCSC-NL](https://github.com/NCSC-NL/log4shell/blob/main/software/README.md) | Zabbix is aware of this vulnerability, has completed verification, and can conclude that the only product where we use Java is Zabbix Java Gateway, which does not utilize the log4j library, thereby is not impacted by this vulnerability. |
