| [CISAGov](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cisagov/log4j-affected-db/develop/README.md) | Compute Engine does not use Log4j 2 and is not impacted by the issues identified in CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. For those using Google Cloud VMware Engine, we are working with VMware and tracking VMSA-2021-0028.1. We will deploy fixes to Google Cloud VMware Engine as they become available. |
